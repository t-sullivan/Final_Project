# Final Project: PartiCoin
## Executive Summary
PartiCoin transforms blockchain engagement by incentivizing users through validation and governance activities. Its unique distribution model, rooted in transparency, drives collaboration and growth. Meme coins add excitement, making PartiCoin a dynamic force in reshaping digital currency dynamics.

## Objectives
The overarching objective of the PartiCoin project is to democratize access to blockchain benefits through an innovative token distribution model rooted in decentralized finance (DeFi) principles.
PartiCoin aims to contribute to a more inclusive financial future by providing opportunities for individuals, including those in underserved regions, to engage meaningfully in the decentralized financial revolution.

## Methodology
#### Token Creation: 
- Develop the PartiCoin contract, set initial supply, and implement necessary functionalities.
#### Engagement Incentivization: 
- Design a smart contract for users to deposit Ethereum, earning PartiCoins based on value and staking duration.
#### Emission and Claim: 
- Implement fair distribution through emission mechanisms and continuous interest for PartiCoin release.

## Tokenomics & Distribution Mechanism
Total Supply: 1,000,000
Symbol: PARTI
Blockchain: Ethereum
Distribution:
- Users receive PartiCoin based on activity, duration, and transaction size.
- Larger transactions yield higher Meme coin rewards.
- Fairness verified through smart contract code.

## Technology Used
### PartiCoin Contract:
- Solidity Version: The contract is written in Solidity version 0.8.20.
- OpenZeppelin Contracts v5.0.0:
- ERC20: The base contract for implementing the ERC-20 standard.
- ERC20Permit: Extension enabling permit function for gasless transactions.
### EthDeposit Contract:
- Solidity Version: The contract is written in Solidity version 0.8.20.
- OpenZeppelin Contracts v5.0.0:
- IERC20: Interface for ERC-20 tokens.
- SafeERC20
- SafeMath
### PartiCoin Contract Integration:
- The EthDeposit contract integrates with the PartiCoin contract to interact with the PartiCoin token.
